# Personal Home Page

A homepage designed to display not only some useful information such as time/date and weather but also include news, daily/funny quotes and more.

# What I learned

- Continued use of CSS Grid and Flexbox
- Perhaps over-extensive use of CSS Animations where not necessary, but made a good learning experience for using CSS Animations
- An excellent learning experience for using a CSS preprocessor to format CSS - Sass in this case (.scss)
- Incorporating JavaScript into websites
- API usage and dynamically loading content from API
  - Finding the limitations of free-to-use API's
  - Maneuvering the nuances of APIs
